Some Symulink blocks that I'm using on my study of System Identification and-Parameter Estimation

1 - PRBS Generator - It's a generator of two values (1 or -1), that is pseudo-random, used to produce an input in some systems.

2 - Multisines - These output is produced by the sum of 5 sine waves using the schroedertechinich of the multisines that each one has a diferent 
phase, so it does not produce overshoot.
